    <h1>Travel to Hawaii</h1>
    <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/landscapes/beach.png" alt="Hawaii" width="300">
    <p id="intro">Hawaii, a U.S. state, is an isolated volcanic archipelago in the Central Pacific. Its islands are 
    renowned for their rugged landscapes of cliffs, waterfalls, tropical foliage and beaches with gold, red, black and 
    even green sands. Of the 6 main islands, Oahu has Hawaii’s biggest city and capital, Honolulu, home to crescent 
    Waikiki Beach and Pearl Harbor's WWII memorials. </p>
    
    <h2>Hawaii has six islands you can explore:</h2>
    <ol>
         <li>The Big Island</li>
         <li>Oahu</li>
         <li>Maui</li>
         <li>Molikai</li>
         <li>Kauai</li>
         <li>Lanai</li>
    </ol>
                     
    <h2>Fun things to do</h2>
    
    <ol>
         <li>Snorkle</li>
         <p id="description"><strong>Kealakekua Bay:</strong> Kealakekua, also known as <strong>“Captain Cook”</strong>, 
         is an underwater marine sanctuary with dolphins and sea turtles. To get to the best spot, you need to take a long hike or rent a kayak.  If you are not into kayaking yourself, you can find many snorkeling boat tours in Kona to visit this secluded sanctuary.</p>
         <li>Luau</li>

         <p id="description"><strong>ALOHA from Germaine's Luao</strong> Take in the rich cultural heritage of the 
          pacific islands. Enjoy the spectacular Polynesian show delivered to you at the ocean's edge, under the stars and 
          palm trees. Be touched by the magic of ancient Hawaii and all its splendor. Feel the spirit of Aloha, experience a 
          Backyard-style Hawaiian Luau and discover why Germaine's Luau is "too good to miss." </p>
          <li>Hike</li>
         <p id="description"><strong>The Lanikai Pillboxes hike (a.k.a, Ka’iwa Ridge Trail)</strong> is well known for being 
         one of the easiest hikes on the island and one of the most scenic. That’s a rare combination. You can complete the 
         hike in an hour or less if you wanted to. But once you see the sweeping views of Kailua and Lanikai from the ridge, 
         you may want to spend more time on the trail.<br>Come at dawn or dusk for the best views.</p>
         <li>Beaches</li>
         <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/landscapes/beach-waves-daytime.png" alt="Beach" width="300">
         <p id="description">For decades, <strong>Waikiki Beach</strong> has been Oahu’s tourist mecca thanks to its palm-fringed white-sand beaches and high-rise luxury hotels that stretch from downtown Honolulu east toward the towering Diamond Head. Here all the spoils of Hawaiian beach life—from sunbathing and swimming to snorkeling and fruity-cocktail sipping—are within steps of world-class shopping and dining.</p>
